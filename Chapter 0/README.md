# Chapter 0: NoSQL

Acording to ```MongoDB``` official documents, we are going to represent some
information about ```NoSQL``` databses.

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.
NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column,
and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

Each NoSQL database has its own unique features. At a high level, many NoSQL databases have the following features:

- Flexible schemas
- Horizontal scaling
- Fast queries due to the data model
- Ease of use for developers

## Types

Over time, four major types of NoSQL databases emerged: document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores,
and graph databases.

- Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
- Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
- Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
- Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.
