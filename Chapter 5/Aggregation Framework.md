Commands used in this lesson:

Connect to the Atlas cluster:
```shell
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"
```

Switch to this database:

```shell
db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
                                  { "$match": { "amenities": "Wifi" } },
                                  { "$project": { "price": 1,
                                                  "address": 1,
                                                  "_id": 0 }}]).pretty()
```

Find one document in the collection and only include the address field in the resulting cursor.
```shell
db.listingsAndReviews.findOne({ },{ "address": 1, "_id": 0 })
```

Project only the address field value for each document, then group all documents into one document per address.country value.
```shell
db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([ { "$project": { "address": 1, "_id": 0 }},
                                  { "$group": { "_id": "$address.country" }}])
```

Project only the address field value for each document, then group all documents into one document per address.country value, and count one for each document in each group.
```shell
db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
                                  { "$project": { "address": 1, "_id": 0 }},
                                  { "$group": { "_id": "$address.country",
                                                "count": { "$sum": 1 } } }
                                ])
