# MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas takes care of time-consuming and costly administration tasks so you can get the database resources you need, when you need them.

MongoDB Atlas combines the power of the document database model with the leverage of the cloud and the power of a full data platform. 


Replica Set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.

Cluster: group of servers that store your data.
